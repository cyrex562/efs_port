Hospitals

" charnel houses where the dead prey on the dead, and the leprous children of the plague defile the air with their rotten stench and choking wheeze, mausoleums whose halls are haunted by moaning night-crackers and stained scarlet by crazed vivisectionists dubbing themselves chiurgeons."

  from Friar Amergo's Travails of Ormu

(An interesting depiction, no doubt, though thankfully not all hospices resemble Amergo's grim picture. Certes the monasteries of the Amaltheans are sanctums of solace and light, though I daresay those odious institutions operated by the Guilds might well inspire Amergo's sort of feverish rant.)
