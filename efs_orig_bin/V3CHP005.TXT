Monopols

And I have even read that the inventors of the Second Republic, in their callous disregard for the Pancreator's will, would through sorcerous arts cause the primal ley lines of metal and earth and sky to bend together, one to the other, and weave conjointly like a great invisible skein. And this unnatural pattern they called MONOPOL, for to them it represented the One of their Invention, an idol they venerated in place of that One who had ordained all things. And, in a further gesture of contempt for the Pancreator's way, the scientists dared to ascribe morality and will to their creation, dubbing it "positive" or "negative" according to the readings of their unholy instruments.
