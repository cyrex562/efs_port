Fusion Beams

"And, thus concluding, the Prophet gestured scornfully, and the Pancreator answered his call. The infidel was lifted as if by an invisible hand and hurled headlong into the fusion beams he had sorcerously evoked; and there was a mighty clap, and a lightning-stench, and a terrible hiss; and then naught remained of the infidel but the thinnest, wavering mist, dimly illumined by the mocking crackle of the beam."

  from the Omega Gospels, chapter 44, verse 43
