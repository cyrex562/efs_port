Psychosocial Engineering

I have oft heard Eskatonics and Amaltheans discourse on this field of endeavor; I have witnessed some of the most learned divines under the Celestial Sun dispute its validity; still I deem its practice to be dangerous rubbish. It is the purview of the Pancreator alone to tamper so with the minds of his chosen. Friar Elzbeita has proved in her Empyrean Dialogues that the mind is but the skin veiling the corpus of the soul; thus he who would divert another's thought-flows, as an engineer rechannels water for the grist mill, in truth imperils the victim's soul.
