Fractal Metaphysics

Oh, I would not commit the error of many of my brethren who casually dismiss all of the Eskatonics' lore as merest parlor tricks. I knew one worthy, a Brother Philo, who in an instant could calculate all manner of astronomical sums, as if the numbers were conjured whole from the Empyrean; and lo, regardless of the problem's difficulty, Philo was always correct.

This divine could, if given a single situational parameter concerning a given event, glean a multitude of conjugal factors and probabilities occluded from other minds. It was folly to dissemble to Philo, and even more foolish to lie; his eyes were lanterns of the Pancreator, discerning the most infinitesimal mote of light in a sea of shadow.

His excommunication was a sore blow to me, and a decision I believe was made in error. Let his intuition fail him not, and let him stay one step ahead of his deluded pursuers until such time as the Pancreator sees fit to demonstrate his innocence.
