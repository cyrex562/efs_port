Parapsychology

That which is Immanent will be revealed to us in due time by the grace of the Pancreator. Are not the Elysian Mysteries, Zebulon's Three-and-Twenty Sacrosanct Liturgies and the Rite of Sapient Silence enough to satisfy the curious? Must every shadow be litten, every abyss plunged, every mystery dispelled?

I adjure thee: I have visited the sanitariums of the Amaltheans, and there, locked fast in cages and strapped to linen-padded frames, lie the gibbering shells of those who sought to know that which the Pancreator has mercifully veiled from our sight. We do not look on the world with the eyes of the Ukar, and based on my eyes' own evidence I would have to conclude that this is a blessing most compassionate.
