Theurgy

My mystic counterparts have told me much of these vaunted "miracles"   and yet I stand firmly opposed to placing all the Church's hopes upon the auspices of strangely empowered relics. These items are best used as symbols, not as incarnate weapons. Furthermore, I question whether the "inner light" such relic-wielders boast of is truly the benefice of the Pancreator; one dulled by klaj-juice may well experience a transient transcendence, but it is a false one, as the spasmodic convulsions upon a klaj-addict's return to consciousness well attest. 

Likewise, I think, with this "theurgy." Its practitioners claim that their ability to empower and animate the great relics of the cathedrals is a sign of the Pancreator's grace. Now certes, the theurge who is able to channel his belief through these relics and thereby heal the sick with but a touch, or place the pilots of the fleets in communion with celestial thrones, or divine the plots of wicked counselors, or smite the sinful to the ground with but a gesture, is as worthy of the Empyrean's grace as any under the Invisible Sun.

Yet, just as in the parable of the ancient terraformer who sought to forge the Spav River with a bridge constructed from the waxen nests of the kili-fly, the means to a goal, if wrongly conceived, can often prostitute the most noble of ends. And mayhap this is the case with theurges and other such cabalists, for they tread perilously close to the left-hand path.
