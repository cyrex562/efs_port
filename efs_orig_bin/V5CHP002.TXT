Space Frigate

And so now I tell of those vessels whose nitrous wings ply the abyssal seas between the ebbing stars, and which, being to all accounts fractious and prone to rampages, are kept in check only by the devilish adeptry of the Charioteers.

The least of the breed, the Space Frigate, is doubtless familiar to the learned or traveled reader, being often seen hovering over planetary horizons or casting its shadow over the disks of the Byzantine moons. I am told that the Frigate is a common enough traveler of the void, being easily summoned through relatively simple Engineering formulae. Though dwarfed by its greater and rarer cousins, the Frigate is nonetheless a dangerous and ruthless beast, and those who would test it in the deeps it calls home do so at their peril.
