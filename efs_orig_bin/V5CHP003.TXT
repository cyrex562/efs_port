Space Destroyer

Next in size, and exponentially superior in ferocity, is the Space Destroyer, aptly named; a vast and ravenous astral predator which, reined only loosely by its Charioteer pilots, seems to delight in spreading wanton carnage, even as the scalpel-eels of the Madocian seas randomly attack fellow aqueous denizens for nothing more than the satiation of bloodlust. Indeed, the Destroyer's habits mimic the scalpel-eel's in many respects, for the Space Destroyer also travels in schools, and excels at indiscriminately taking down prey of all sizes, greater and smaller alike.
