Space Cruiser

Greater yet than the Destroyer, that astral behemoth known as the Space Cruiser plies the jumplanes like one of the extinct cetaceans of Terra. It is more sluggish than the Destroyer, and less prone to rash attacks. Nay, the Cruiser is a methodical and malignant beast, preferring to strike from a distance and then glide slowly and implacably toward its crippled prey.

It is slow and may be outdistanced in a protracted chase, so the Cruiser prefers to ambush its prey upon its emergence from the jumpgates. And if its attack is perhaps less immediately effacious than the Destroyer's, it is more certain in the long term; few vessels struck and stalked by this monster return to their ports to tell the tale.
