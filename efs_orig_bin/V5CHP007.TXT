Battle Carrier

"From the mouth of the jumpgate glided the great Battle Carrier, and the pirates were stricken with woe. From its gleaming sides detached swarms of fighting craft themselves too small to travel the gate unaided which blazed among the hapless marauders like animate buzzsaws; and those pirates who escaped the fury of the children were blasted into nothingness by the weapons of the parent craft; and thus were the Aragonese Marches made secure."
