Freighter

The symbol of all that plagues the cosmos; verily, I fear these more than the war-golems. For while the latter at least annihilate the wicked with the good, the Guild Freighters are the veriest parasites, touching down on planet after planet like ticks lancing a babe's vulnerable hide. 

Into these creatures' stomachs the vermin of the Guilds stuff all manner of filth, that they might transport their poisons across the abyss to pollute yet more of the innocent. Most Freighters prefer to transport only one sort of good; thus, fleets of Freighters often touch down on untainted planets   one bearing narcotics, another carrying slaves, and yet a third hauling illicit manuscripts of all kinds.
