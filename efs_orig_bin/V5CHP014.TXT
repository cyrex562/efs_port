Bulk Hauler

If the Freighter is the wandering priest of the Guilds, then these floating fortresses are surely the very temples of evil! These hives of vice crawl from one defenseless world to the next, bearing the League's tainted poisons. Yea, everything from the Manual of the 523 Indecorous Positions of Vritna the Scourged, to the pornographic tracts of Lun-shansi the Defrocked, to the soporific nectars of the Cadavan Breweries are stowed and smuggled on these floating brothels.

The Church has time and time again petitioned the Regency to outlaw such licentious commerce, but mere matters of the soul are not given overmuch consideration in these times, and so not a day goes by but that some world's atmosphere chokes on the stink of the Bulk Hauler, as it lands like a pustulent cyst to vomit out its wares.
