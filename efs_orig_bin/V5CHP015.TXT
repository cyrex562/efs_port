Starbase

Is not the bounty of the Pancreator enough? Are we not content with an entire universe of worlds, that we must now construct artificial ones? Oh ye fools how can ye expect the Pancreator to stay His hand, when ye mock Him so? It is meet that we divorce ourselves from the world of our birth and go among the stars, such is His will, but must ye spurn the spheres ordained for habitation in favor of these orbiting metal abominations, which cannot even support human life save by technomancy?
