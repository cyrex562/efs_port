Dervishes

Among the strangest of the destroyed infidel sects were the Dervishes of Grail bizarre flagellants and child-killers who claimed devotion to the false prophet Zegai. Zegai instructed her followers in the performance of strange magical arts, no doubt rained on her from those powers lurking in the abyss cloaking the dark side of some forgotten asteroid.

Victims who fell into the Dervishes' snares suffered from all manner of bizarre spasms and fits, as their inner light literally collapsed upon itself. Their reason clouded, the victims would confusedly wander off into the wastes of Grail, singing mad songs and speaking of possession by supernatural intelligences.

The Dervishes' destruction in 4833 was a blessing to all virtuous persons. Recently the Inquisition has gotten wind of rumors that not all the Dervishes were destroyed, but these rumors are likely hateful propaganda, undoubtedly spread by the Guilds in an attempt to weaken the suzerainty of Holy Church.
