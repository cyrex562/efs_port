Assassin

"And this I see: The wars are nigh unto their end, and it shall be Vladimir, of House Alecto, who claws his way onto the throne. But the Alecto will not long enjoy the spoils of his victory; for from the darkness will fall the tyrant's judgment, in the form of a stealthy assassin. Whether the emperor's doom will be the virus or the blade, the beam or the spell, I escry not; but la, the assassin shall strike true, and so the houses will once more plunge into the cauldron of war."

  from the Prophecies of Nebt

(For a heretic, Nebt was uncannily accurate in her prophecies, and so one cannot help but conclude that the sibyl was in league with the very forces that laid Vladimir low.)
