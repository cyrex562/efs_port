Cybercorps

Woe and mercy unto the Ghazi Cybercorps of Li Halan, for the burden they must bear! How selflessly they assume the disfiguring affliction of technology their noble gaze forever shut behind mirrored panels, their manly thews replaced by wires and servos. Truly these stalwarts, whose devotion is unquestioned, embody the virtues of the penitent; by their actions they assume a mantle of bodily purgatory, that they might more readily defend the realm.
