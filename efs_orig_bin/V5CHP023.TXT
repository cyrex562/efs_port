No abomination is too vile for the magicians of the Guilds. These fiends, unsatisfied with the evocation of living war-monsters, would even cannibalize the corpses of those giants fallen on the fields of battle. Through the artifices of the propane torch and the arc welder these villains evoke a bizarre form of necromancy, whereby the skeleton of one such brute is grafted to the frame of another, and the composite given a horrid undead life thereby.
