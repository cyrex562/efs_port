Wolfen

The Wolfen is to its larger cousins as a flea is to a ptero-gokk; but take care, for even a flea may carry a deadly sting. I have heard tales from my comrades in the Brothers Battle horrible stories of Wolfen swarms ravening over hills and dunes to overwhelm any who stand in their way. Only the strongest of fortifications may defy them, and the lone infantry platoon who faces the Wolfen might as well consign itself to the void.
