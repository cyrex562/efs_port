Kestral Hover Tank

Over the fields of carnage glides the Kestral, deceptively graceful, a veritable raptor of war. Not so elephantine as the Mastiff, the Kestral surpasses its larger cousin in maneuverability. Flocks of Kestrals confound their quarry through the execution of synchronized and precise flanking actions, and I maintain that the Kestral finds a perverse satisfaction in the terror of a doomed platoon whose members realize they have been irrevocably cut off from the main body.

Then oh, horror! the Kestrals circle in, gradually tightening the arc of their flight, strafing the hapless soldiers with all manner of energies, and the sizzle of charred flesh is as sweet to the predators as is incense to the pious priest.
