Wraith Cloaking Tank

The barbarians often enter into unholy pacts with the warlocks in our midst, and from them gain witchy gifts that, while condemning their souls to the lowest of hells, wreak great havoc upon the Pancreator's chosen. 

I have recently been apprised of a story from the Vuldrok frontier, wherein a cunning chieftain, having concluded a pact with a notorious witch known to haunt the outer wastes, received from her a contrivance that could through dint of evil magic render a great war-golem imperceptible to godly eyes. And having cast this magic on a captured tank, this chieftain guided his weapon to the very gates of An-Mulok, and brought the walls down.
