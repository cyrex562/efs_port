Infantry

Put not your trust in soldiers, be they the cataphracts of the Regency, the skirmishers of the Muster, or the janissaries of the al-Malik; for did not the Prophet write: "Place no faith in warriors, be they the assembled legions of the scattered stars, for only in the grace of the Invisible Sun shall ye be succored, and evil banished into the outermost dark.
