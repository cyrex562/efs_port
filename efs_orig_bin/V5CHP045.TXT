Tracker Legion

And though no house, not even the Li Halan, has completely retained its virtue in the face of expediency, the worst by far is the Decados. May the Pancreator keep these apostates from gaining the throne, for it seems that no stratagem, no tactic is too devious or amoral for them. They harbor warlocks and fraternize with the worst elements among the Guilds; yea, I have heard that they have even trained certain of their commandos in the questionable arts of Soma, whereby they may physically alter their shape and, having thus camouflaged themselves, infiltrate local populaces as saboteurs and scouts.

The lords of the Decados should take heed of the Church's censure, lest their troops transform themselves indeed: from Urthling to demon-possessed fiend.
